<p>Take the input, transform one of its digit, check for prime,&nbsp;increment&nbsp;the&nbsp;transform_level by 1 for the modified room number and <strong>enqueue</strong>. All possible configurations of the room number will be present in the Queue until you find the destination room number. Since it&#39;s a BFS, you wont need to keep track of the best transformation. The Algorithm will take care of it. Now, after a few iterations, if you <strong>dequeue</strong> the queue and get the result, the transform_level associated with that dequeued string would give you the answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just find the range of L and R (depending upon x) where update is required for each query and then add +1 to arr[L]&nbsp;</p>

<p>and add -1 to arr[R+1].</p>

<p>Do this for all the queries.</p>

<p>A similar question was done in Wednesday&#39;s class.</p>
,<p>sorry i misread the question.I thought the question asked to update all indices.But the questions asks to update only those indices which satisfies the equation.</p>

<p>@lostground97 is right.</p>
,<p>mathematically your approach is correct but since there is always a loss of precision when working with floating-point&nbsp; numbers(while doing any arithemetic/trigonometric operation) this apporach will never give accurate results.</p>

<p>Instead what you could do is create a structure which will allow you to operate on fractions. This was you can operate on p and q seperatly and it will never result in loss of precision.</p>

<pre>
<code>struct fraction
{
   int num; //numerator
   int den; //denominator
};
fraction subtraction(fraction fract1,fraction fract2)   //for subtraction of two fractions
{
         fraction result;
         result.num = (fract1.num * fract2.den) - (fract2.num* fract1.den);
         result.den = (fract1.den * fract2.den);
         return result;     
}   
fraction multiplication(fraction fract1,fraction fract2)   //for multiplying two fractions
{
         fraction result;
         result.num = (fract1.num * fract2.num);
         result.den = (fract1.den * fract2.den);
         return result;
}
 
//likewise for other arithmetical operations</code></pre>

<p>aslo you can&#39;t directly use trigonometric function to find cos (t*theta) as it will also not give precise results.</p>

<p>so you have to use divide and conquer + subtract and conquer strategy with&nbsp;memonization to get 100 pts.</p>

<p>we already have the value of cos(theta),</p>

<p>now if t is power of 2 then we can easily get value of cos(t*theta) using the identity cos (2*theta)=2*cos^2(theta) -1 in divide and conquer.</p>

<p>If t is not power of two then we can break t in two terms A and B ,where A is power of 2 and can use the identity : cos (A+B)=2cosA*cosB-cos(A-B)</p>

,<p>Your function prototype is wrong.</p>

<p>Since the first parameter is an array, it should be,</p>

<pre>
<code>int sumfinder(int*,int,int);
OR
int sumfinder(int [],int,int);</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>code link doesn&#39;t contain the code.<br />
question marked as answered.</p>
,<pre>
you have used this:
a[n]=max(n,(max(n/2,a[n/2])+max(n/3,a[n/3])+max(n/4,a[n/4])));
the func function is called only once in the main function and never 
in the function itself...therefore no recursion..
no memoization..no values stored in a (a will be empty).
ans this expression will simply evaluate to - 
a[n]=max(n,(max(n/2,0)+max(n/3,0)+max(n/4,0)));
so func will return with just one call.

</pre>
,<p>The rank of every point is pre-decided based on the rule mentioned in the problem statement. If you consider the rectangle with diagonal (0, 0) and (1, 2) - the points within the rectangle are: (0, 0): Rank 1, (0, 1): Rank 2 ,(1, 0): Rank 3 ,(0, 2): Rank 4 ,(1, 1): Rank 5, (1, 2): Rank 8 Hence, the maximum rank within the given rectangle is 8.</p>
,<p>your code is going into infinite loop since you have used the testcase variable t inside the for loop.</p>

<pre>
<code>while(t--)</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
<code> if(a[i]==(i+1))
   {
    t=a[i+1];
    a[i+1]=a[i];
    a[i]=t;
   }</code></pre>

<p>I think you intented to use j over there.</p>

<p>Also you need to print the numbers with spaces</p>

<pre>
<code>  cout&lt;&lt;a[i]&lt;&lt;"" ""; </code></pre>

<p>Avoid doing such silly mistakes while writing code and strictly follow the input/output format. Also test your code by checking it for inputs others than the one&#39;s provided in the testcases.</p>

<p>P.S- I haven&#39;t checked your logic to this problem.Hence you may still get WA if it&#39;s not correct.</p>
,<p>check the problem constraint :</p>

<pre>
<code>0 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 100
</code></pre>

<p>and size of your hash array is 50. So if a[i][j]&gt;=50 ,line hash[a[i][j]] gives a segmentation fault.</p>

<p>Keep the size of hash array 101 to avoid segmentation fault.</p>
,<p>use :</p>

<pre>
<code>  scanf(""%s"",&amp;a);</code></pre>

<p>inplace of:</p>

<pre>
<code>  gets(a);</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;avoid the use of gets() whenever possible.</p>
,<pre>
<code>  scanf(""%s"",a); //(no &amp; before a)</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>in worst case:<br />
n=10^5<br />
and all a[i]=10^9</p>

<p>then sum of all array elements= (10^9 + 10^9 + .....(10^5 times))</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =10^9 * 10^5</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =10^14 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>this sum will easily fit in long long int.</p>

<code>long long sum=0;
for(i=0;i&lt;n;i++)
 sum+=arr[i];

double average=(sum*1.0)/n;</code></pre>

,<p>DP formula should be :<br />
a[n]=max(n,func(n/2)+func(n/3)+func(n/4));</p>
,<p>Firstly you are declaring a fixed sized array arr with 100005 elements and then sorting using sort funtion in STL.</p>

<pre>
<code>int r=sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
sort(arr,arr+r);</code></pre>

<p>Suppose the value of n for a particular testcase is 10,but the above code sorts&nbsp; all 100005 elements so the resultant array contains garbage values.</p>

<p>first parameter to sort function must be the&nbsp; starting address of the array and second parameter ,the end address upto which sorting is to be performed on the array.</p>

<pre>
<code>sort(arr,arr+n);</code></pre>

<p>Before using any STL function google and read about it don&#39;t just blindly copy code without understanding.</p>

<p>Coming to the Binary search implementation of yours ,i don&#39;t think you are clear with the concept.</p>

<p>read this article first : <a href=""https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/binary-search/"">https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/binary-search/</a></p>

<p>you can view my solution here: <a href=""https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/17845125"">https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/17845125</a></p>

<p>I have added comments for better understanding.</p>
,<p>See the constraints</p>

<pre>
<code>1 ≤ U, V ≤ pow(10,9)
</code></pre>

<p>the maximum size of your array a is 100000. So in your code when (x+y)&gt;=100000,segmentation fault(SIGSEGV) occurs.</p>

<pre>
<code>z=x+y;
s=a[z];</code></pre>

<p>I have no idea what made to choose this limit of 100000!</p>

<p>READ PROBLEM CONSTRAINTS CAREFULLY.!...When you are writing code try to understand what each line of your code does ...take your time. Don&#39;t just do stuff randomly hoping it would work out.</p>
,<p>It is not necessary to take input as an intger.So if you are using c++ then input the number as string and then use that string for further operation.</p>

<pre>
<code>#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);cin.tie(NULL); //include this line for fast input/output in c++
  int t;
  cin&gt;&gt;t; //use cin to take input and cout for output
  string n;
  while(t--)
  {
	cin&gt;&gt;n;
        //your code
  }
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<pre>
<code>for(i=0;i&lt;len;i++)
{
 if(isupper(s1[i]))
    s3[i]=tolower(s1[i]);

 else if(islower(s1[i]))
    s3[i]=s1[i];

 if(isupper(s2[i]))
   s4[i]=tolower(s2[i]);

 else if(islower(s2[i]))
    s4[i]=s2[i];

 }</code></pre>

<p>This part of your code is causing segmentation fault. Strings are stored like arrays. You have declared s3 and s4 but you can&#39;t index them until you store something in them.&nbsp; After taking s1 and s2 as input just initialize s3 with s1 and s4 with s2</p>

<p>s3=s1;</p>

<p>s4=s2;</p>

<p>Now you are good to go.</p>

<p>Also when using cin,cout include this line in your code for faster input/output.(Not necessary for this problem though)</p>

<p>std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);</p>

,<p>for first subtask: an array element can be as high as pow(10,8).Won&#39;t even pass one query.</p>

<p>Your logic isn&#39;t correct either. I think you misunderstood the question. The question doesn&#39;t ask you to find if a given string is palindrome or not but whether two halves of the string have same characters and same frequency of each characters.</p>

<p>Hint : use hashing.</p>

<p>And from next time use the insert code snippet option to paste the code..makes it easier to read code. :)</p>

create an array of this stucture and store information of all the given m exams(say arr).<br />
now sort this array in increasing order based on exam day Di.(Why? - think)<br />
create an array of intergers to store the result.Initially all the elments of this array are 0(say res).<br />
now iterate through the sorted array arr one by one keeping a counter initialized to 0 (cnt) and for each exam,iterate from Si to Di and<br />
if(cnt&lt;Ci):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(res[i]==0):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase cnt by 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;res[i]=Ni<br />
else: break<br />
now just check if value of cnt equals Ci of current exam.<br />
if no, then petya cannot prepare for the this exam and ans is -1 , otherwise proceed to the next exam.<br />
finally your answer is in the array res(given he can prepare for all the exams).</p>

,<p>For every number<br />
n &gt; 1, there is a unique prime factorization<br />
<br />
n=p1^a1 * p2^a2 *....*pk^ak<br />
where p1 , p2 , . . . , pk are distinct primes and a1 , a2 , . . . , ak are positive numbers.<br />
For example, the prime factorization for 12 is<br />
12 = 2 ^2 *3 ^1<br />
<br />
Numbers a and b are coprime if gcd( a, b ) = 1. Euler&rsquo;s totient function &phi; ( n )<br />
gives the number of coprime numbers to n between 1 and n . For example,<br />
&phi; (12) = 4, because 1, 5, 7 and 11 are coprime to 12.<br />
<br />
Euler&#39;s totient function is given by:</p>

<p>&phi; ( n )=product[(pi^(ai-1))*(pi-1)] (i ranges from 1 to k)<br />
<br />
&phi; (12) = [{(2 ^(2-1))*(2 &minus; 1)} * {(3 ^(1-1))* (3 &minus; 1)}] = 4<br />
<br />
Hence, to find the Euler&#39;s totient function for n ,we can first find the frequency of each unique prime factor of n and then simply apply the above formula.<br />
<br />
IMPLEMENTATION :</p>

<pre>
<code>    unordered_map&lt;int,int&gt; m;
    for (int i = 2; i*i&lt;=n; ++i) {
        while(n%i==0) {
            m[i]++;
            n/=i;
        }
    }
    if (n&gt;1) {
        m[n]++;
    }
    long long ans=1;
    for(auto it : m){
        ans*=pow(it.first,it.second-1)*(it.first-1);
    }
 </code></pre>

<p>Complexity: O(&radic;n)</p>
,<p>for n = 7 o/p will be 5.<br />
Just change this condition</p>

<pre>
while(n&gt;9) to something less than 7</pre>
,<p>For a given value of n there can be only two possibilites :<br />
1) n will give the maximum value .<br />
2) exchange n into three coins : n/2, n/3 and n/4 and sum of these will give the maximum value.<br />
these correspond to two states.<br />
<br />
You can use :<br />
a[n]=max(n,(max(n/2,fun(n/2))+max(n/3,fun(n/3))+max(n/4,fun(n/4))));<br />
which basically reduces to:<br />
a[n]=max(n,func(n/2)+func(n/3)+func(n/4));</p>
,<p>QUICK EXPLANATION:</p>

<p>Precalculate <em>Y</em>0</p>

<p>for unchanged string and arrays <em>B</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>c</em>] and <em>F</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>c</em>] holding number of letters less than <em>c</em> before position <em>i</em> and number of letters larger than <em>c</em> after position <em>i</em> correspondingly. After that you can try each single switch on position <em>i</em> from letter <em>c</em>1 to letter <em>c</em>2 having following formulas:</p>

<p><em>X</em>=|<em>c</em>1&minus;<em>c</em>2|,</p>

<p><em>Y</em>=<em>Y</em>0&minus;(<em>B</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>c</em>1]+<em>F</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>c</em>1])+(<em>B</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>c</em>2]+<em>F</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>c</em>2])</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whole solution works in <em>O</em>(<em>N</em>&sdot;&Sigma;)</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>EXPLANATION:</p>

<p>Your solution has to be subquadratic to get 100 points. Thus it would be okay if you try to change every single letter and calculate new value of <em>Y</em></p>

<p>. What is the impact single letter <em>c</em> in position <em>i</em> makes for the whole <em>Y</em>? It&#39;s number of letters less than <em>c</em> before <em>i</em> plus number of letters larger than <em>c</em> after <em>i</em>. If we calculate those values in advance for all possible <em>i</em> and <em>c</em> alongside with some initial <em>Y</em>0 for unchanged string, it will be possible for us to recalculate <em>Y</em> after we change letter at position <em>i</em> from <em>c</em>1 to <em>c</em>2</p>

<p>(see formulas from quick explanation). We can calculate values as follows:</p>

<pre>
<code>string S;
cin &gt;&gt; S;
for(auto &amp;it: S) {
    it -= 'a';
}
int N = S.size();
int Sigma = 26;

int B[N][Sigma], F[N][Sigma];
memset(B, 0, sizeof(B));
memset(F, 0, sizeof(F));

int64_t Y0 = 0;
for(int i = 1; i &lt; N; i++) {
    int B_idx = i, F_idx = N - i - 1; // we run B_idx from 1 to N-1 and F_idx from N-2 to 0.
    for(int c = 0; c &lt; Sigma; c++) {
        B[B_idx][c] = B[B_idx - 1][c] + (S[B_idx - 1] &lt; c);
        F[F_idx][c] = F[F_idx + 1][c] + (S[F_idx + 1] &gt; c);
    }
    Y0 += B[B_idx][S[B_idx]];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can try every possible switch and choose the best option:</p>

<pre>
<code>int64_t ans = Y0;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
    for(int c = 0; c &lt; Sigma; c++) {
        int X = abs(S[i] - c);
        int64_t Y = Y0 - (B[i][S[i]] + F[i][S[i]]) + (B[i][c] + F[i][c]);
        ans = min(ans, X + Y);
    }
}
cout &lt;&lt; ans &lt;&lt; endl;

,<p>you are correct that we have to find&nbsp; ans% (10^9 +7), but in such questions the val of ans becomes so large(it won&#39;t fit in long long) that if you just calculate the actual ans and then modulo it in the final step you will get a wrong result. Hence, in such questions you have to apply modular properties.<br />
<br />
Some of the properties which are generally used are :<br />
<br />
1. (a + b) % c&nbsp; = ((a % c) + (b % c)) % c<br />
2. (a * b) % c&nbsp; =&nbsp; ((a % c) * (b % c)) % c<br />
3. (a - b) % c&nbsp; =&nbsp; ((a % c) - (b % c) + c) % c</p>

,<p>In this question we have to find the no of substrings starting and ending both with &#39;1&#39;.<br />
for input string (str) : 10001<br />
the substrings are : 10001 (str[0] to str[4]), 1 (str[0]), 1 (str[4]). Hence, answer is 3.<br />
Note that a substring of length one which contains the character &#39;1&#39; is also starting and ending with 1, hence it will also add to our answer.</p>
,<p>for each j-th iteration you are finding the next minimum value but you are missing the essential step of assigning that value to the current i-th index.<br />
for array input :<br />
5 9 10 7 4<br />
your code does the following in the i-th iteration :<br />
5 9 10 7 5 ( i = 0)<br />
5 9 10 9 7 (i = 1)<br />
5 9 10 10 9 (i = 2)<br />
5 9 10 10 10 (i = 3)<br />
5 9 10 10 10 (i = 4)<br />
fix this by adding the following line :</p>

<pre>
<code>    for (int i = 0; i &lt; t; ++i) {
        int q = a[i];
        for (int j = i; j &lt; t; ++j) {
            if (q &gt; a[j]) {
                int p = q;
                q = a[j];
                a[j] = p;
            }
        }
        a[i] = q;  // add this line
    }</code></pre>

<p>Now this is correct. Still i would recommend you to use inbuilt sort function in C++ as it is much faster than this selection sort algorithm.<br />
complexity of selection sort : O(n ^ 2)<br />
inbuilt sort function complexity : O(nlog(n))<br />
to use the inbuilt sort function use the following code(assuming array name a and size n):<br />
sort(a, a + n);<br />
(NOTE : use header file #include&lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt; to use this sort function)</p>
,<ul>
	<li style=""list-style-type:disc"">
	<p>max(ri) &le; min(Cj)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because ri &le; t[i][j] &le; Cj</p>
	</li>
	<li style=""list-style-type:disc"">
	<p>The desired equality isn&rsquo;t true only if max(ri) &lt; min(Cj), and then we must increase max(ri) or decrease min(Ci), or do both. In order to increase max(ri), it&rsquo;s enough to change elements in one row only (increase ri for one i). Similarly, to decrease min(Ci), it&rsquo;s enough to change elements in one column.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we know the value X = max(ri) = min(Cj) in the optimal solution. Then we should choose one row and change to X all numbers smaller than X, and similarly choose one column and change to X all numbers<br />
greater than X.</p>

<ul>
	<li style=""list-style-type:disc"">
	<p>Slow approach: iterate over each pair of row and column. For each value X occurring in the row or the column, count the cost of the row as the number of elements smaller than X, and the cost of the column as the number of elements greater than X. Consider the sum of those two costs as the answer.<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>&nbsp;O(n^2 log(n)) solution: sort all n^2 values and process them in the increasing order. In each moment, for the current value X, we should know costs of all rows and costs of all columns. The possible answer is the sum of costs of the best row and the best column.</li>

,<p>Here is how you approach ....<br />
Sort all the edges ,now connect the edges in increasing order of their weights...<br />
Make sure whenever there is a special node ...while joining make the special node the parent node ..so that you node that there is a special node in this set...</p>

<p>Joining process<br />
If both the roots are special ,then this edge is important...means you have to use it to visit all the special nodes...<br />
If only one is special ...then this edge is not important ....it could be a case that this connection is not needed...<br />
If none are special .then too the edge is not important ..</p>

Here we check the condition for each pair of number in array.<br />
The&nbsp; naive solution would be:</p>

<pre>
<code>long long int answer = 0;  
    for(int i =0 ; i &lt; N ; i++)
        for(int j = 0 ; i&lt; N ; j++)
            if( (A[i] + A[j] &lt;= x)
                answer++;
    cout&lt;&lt;answer&lt;&lt;endl;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this solution will result in TLE verdict.</p>

<p><br />
<u><em><strong>Better Approach</strong></em></u></p>

<p>We are required to find all such pairs (A[i],A[j]) in A[] such that A[i]+A[j]&lt;=X</p>

<p>First recall the property of modulo:<br />
(a + b)%m = (a%m + b%m)%m<br />
Using the value of a%m and b%m instead of a and b respectively will produce same result.</p>

<p>Thus, if our array contains A[i]%M, there will not be any change in result. For eg., if inputs are like<br />
1<br />
6 10 8<br />
3 8 23 5 33 15</p>

<p>Array A = {3,8,3,5,3,5}</p>

<p>As we can see that<br />
A[i]&lt;M,&nbsp; so<br />
A[i]+A[j]&lt;2*M,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where(A[i] and A[j] are any two elements of A)</p>

<p>This range could be divided into four regions:<br />
0&lt;=region1&lt;=x, x&lt;region2&lt;M, M&lt;=region3&lt;=M+x, M+x&lt;region4&lt;2*M</p>

<p>It could be seen that if our sum lies in region1 or region3, sum%M&lt;=x</p>

<p>Here, cases which may arise are:</p>

<p><u><em>Case 1</em></u>: A[i]&lt;=x<br />
Here for each A[i], valid A[j] could lie in region1 or region3.<br />
Valid range of A[j]:<br />
For region1, 0 &lt;= A[j] &lt;= x-A[i]<br />
For region3, (M-A[i]) &lt;= A[j] &lt;= (M-1)</p>

<p><u><em>Case 2</em></u>: A[i]&gt;x<br />
Here, for each A[i], valid A[j] could only lie in region3<br />
Valid range of A[j]:<br />
For region3, (M-A[i]) &lt;= A[j] &lt;= (M+x-A[i])</p>

<p>Therefore, the problem reduces to find the count of A[j] which lies in certain countinous range. To do this, we make another array B whose size is equal to M and ith index stores the number of i in array A[].&nbsp; Thus, B = {0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,1,0} (as per example given above)<br />
And let another array C store prefix sum of B,i.e.<br />
C = {0,0,0,3,3,5,5,5,6,6}</p>

<p>Now, count of numbers whose value lies in range say r1 to r2 will be C[r2]-C[r1-1](when r1=0 the ans will only be C[r2]).</p>

<p>Hope this clears your doubt!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>The cities will be connected as:</p>

<p>-13R&nbsp; ----&nbsp; -10P (cost = 3)</p>

<p>-10P&nbsp; ----&nbsp; -1P (cost = 9)</p>

<p>-10P&nbsp; ----&nbsp; -6R (cost = 4)</p>

<p>-1P&nbsp; &nbsp; ----&nbsp; 10P (cost = 11)</p>

<p>-1P&nbsp; &nbsp; ----&nbsp; 4R (cost = 5)</p>

<p>Total cost = 32</p>
,<p>Error is in the following line</p>

<pre>
<code>a=Long.parseLong(br.readLine());
b=Long.parseLong(br.readLine());</code></pre>

<p>In the input, two space seaparated integers are given in a <u>single line</u>.<br />
<em>br.readLine()</em> reads entire line. Thus, for the first query of sample input(the one given in input example of the question) it will return string &quot;1 4&quot;. By using <em>Long.parseLong()</em>, you are trying to convert a string(here it is &quot;1 4&quot;) <u>containing space</u> into a number. This will result in runtime error.</p>

<p>The solution for this would be:</p>

<pre>
<code>String[] temp = br.readLine().split();
a = Long.parseLong(temp[0]);
b = Long.parseLong(temp[1]);</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use user-defined functions for faster input/output. <a href=""https://pastebin.com/w21V9aV5"">Here</a>, is the link for this. Below is the is the method to take input in the given case.</p>

,<p>Yes, Normal Brute force will result in&nbsp;TLE. Because since your N is of order 10^5 and number of updates is 2*10^5 thus in worst &nbsp;case scenario your code will be performing 2*10^10 iterations. Time Complexity of your code is O(U*N). Thus will result in Time Limit Exceeded Error.</p>

<p>To solve this we have a standard algorithm called <strong>Mo&#39;s Algorithm</strong> which is a special case of&nbsp;<strong>Square Root Decomposition</strong>. The time complexity of this algorithm is <strong>O((U+N)*sqrt(N))</strong>. Which will easily pass in 1 sec.</p>

<p>For example - we cant store a value such as 1234567891111 in an integer datatype.in such cases we store the value of this&nbsp;number modulo 10^9+7(generally)...So your answer should be&nbsp;&nbsp;1234567891111%(10^9+7)[in this case]</p>

<p>Now coming&nbsp;to finding factorial ,</p>

<p>consider finding 30!</p>

<p>try analysing the number of digits in that number .. they are way to many to be stored in an integer datatype..</p>

<p>You could argue that we can find the value of 30! first and then take the mod...that would give an incorrect result ..because the value of 30! itself cannot be stored ..</p>

<p>By using the line &quot;f = (f*i) % M;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;, we make sure the value of the result is always in the range which can be stored by us.</p>

<p>If you dont get this ,try calculating all the factorial from 1 to 20 and store in integer datatype and check the values...&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>You are considering jumps in pnly those cases in which the jump is equal to U or D..the question states that he can jump upto U height...</p>

<p>consider the case :</p>

<p>5 2 2</p>

<p>1 2 3 2 1</p>

<p>In this case ,he can reach the fifth hill....</p>

<p>Try it with this approach...</p>
,<p>check this line</p>

<p>//&nbsp; &nbsp;if(int(s[i])==f)</p>

<p>you want to check the equality of the digits...but this statement is not doing the same</p>

<p>int&nbsp;(&#39;6&#39;)&nbsp; != 6</p>

<p>try to run this in your compiler</p>

<p>char ch =6;</p>

<p>cout&lt;&lt;int(ch);</p>

<p>use this fact and try again :)</p>
,<p>try considering this test case:</p>

<p>3 74 51<br />
75 2<br />
77 7<br />
80 9</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>See,if after correcting this it still gives a wrong answer....</p>

<p>My approach would be to find the value of [mid] month and [mid -1] month ..</p>

<p>if sum of [mid] month is greater than required and sum of [mid-1] month is less then required&nbsp; than mid is the answer ..otherwise continue binary search...</p>
,<p>Think about this approach:</p>

<p>Traverse the matrix in row wise manner...</p>

<p>Now ,when traversing the elements keep a check ,if the element just below and towards the right are in the sense that the increasing order is maintained other wise the arrangement is not possible...</p>

<p>consider this example...</p>

<pre>
1 2 2 3
1 -1 7 -1
6 -1 -1 -1
-1 -1 -1 -1</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now in 1 st row traversal ,you traverse 1 ,2,2, 3..in each case you compare it with the bottom and right member ...the&nbsp; sequence is maintained.</p>

<p>Similarly do it with the 2nd row and all the rows;</p>

<p>if at any time ,you visit a -1.. compare the values of the element just above -1 and just towards the left of it....whatever be the greater of them ..store it in the index containing -1(because that is the least value you can store in it..if the sequene is to be maintained....</p>

<p>and then again perform a check of the sequence ... i.e comparing it with the right and bottom element.... do the same and avoid check for the corner elements...</p>

<p>Hope this would be helpful.. :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>I think you missed the point that all the tables should be queried ....</p>

<p>consider the case</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>100</p>

<p>10 9</p>

<p>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</p>

<p>99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99 99</p>

<p>In this case 10 tables are privided to group B ,but only 9 queries are done...</p>

<p>Hence the project is incomplete.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>Look at its editorial once....</p>

<p>If you try iterating over k...the looping factor decreases by a factor of k... just like the time complexity of sieve...</p>

<p>This is the editorialist&#39;s approach...</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with learning how to place lamps of fixed power to cover the segment with the minimal number of them. The following greedy strategy works: find the rightmost non-blocked position that is covered by lamps and place lamp there until either everything is covered or rightmost free position is to the left of the last placed lamp. Initially you only consider&nbsp;0&nbsp;to be covered. Function&nbsp;f(i)&nbsp;&mdash; the minimal number of post lamps to cover segment&nbsp;[0;i]&nbsp;is clearly monotonous, thus you want to update states as early as possible.</p>

<p>Okay, now you iterate over all&nbsp;l&isin;[1;k]l&isin;[1;k]&nbsp;and update the answer with the results multiplied by cost.</p>

<p>Now, why will this work fast? You obviously precalculate the rightmost free position for each prefix segment. If there are any free positions to the right of last placed lamp then the rightmost of them will always be the rightmost for the entire prefix segment. Finally, any two consecutive iterations of the algorithm will either move you by&nbsp;k+1&nbsp;positions or return&nbsp;-1. This can be easily proven by contradiction.</p>

<p>Overall complexity:&nbsp;O(n&sdot;logn), as you do about&nbsp;n/l&nbsp;steps for each&nbsp;l&nbsp;and that is a common series sum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>How I Would approach this would be ..</p>

<p>I would place a lamp at an unoccupied position...and then go to the place after k position...if it is blocked..then I would go the last unlocked place to the left of it and place a lamp there.....if it still lands in a blocked position after k positions...then it isn&#39;t possible with that k to lighten the lamp.... If it lands in an unblocked position then keep repeating...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You just have to find the left unoccupied position to a blocked position&nbsp; in O(1) time ...</p>

<p>And i think the solution would be O(nlogn) too...</p>
,<p>Yes ,your approach is correct...</p>

<p>(s/k+1)steps up and down for s%k times and remaining steps were of length s/k..&nbsp;</p>

<p>Few corner cases would be if the maximum jump allowed is (s/k) then you can&#39;t jump the distance of(s/k+1)</p>

<p>if(s/k is zero) you would land in the same place at some time...(jump will have to be of zero size).</p>
,<p>I see you have already found the solution...</p>

<p>I am posting the link for others to view...</p>

<p><a href=""https://leetcode.com/articles/beautiful-arrangement/"">https://leetcode.com/articles/beautiful-arrangement/</a></p>
,<p>I guess you have found out how the tree is built...</p>

<p>Now you just have to traverse the tree....By maintaining a column counter ...</p>

<p>and maintain a map of type &lt;int,vector&lt;char&gt;&gt; globally....</p>

<p>Now before Moving to the left subtree decrease the counter by 1 and after the left subbranch is completed and you backtrack to the same function increase the counter again(as you reach the same node).... same goes for the right subtree(increase it first and then decrease it when you backtrack the recursion)...</p>

Please read the question statement again carefully. In the above code, you are not calculating the cumulative score after each round.</p>
,<p>Firstly, please use the fact that all elements are in range of 1 to n and occur exactly once. So do you need to create the vector &quot;ss&quot; that you have used and sort it? The position in sorted array of any element will be the element itself.</p>

<p>Second, this would have been my approach.&nbsp;Let us create islands using the provided binary string. A group of 1s and a single&nbsp;following 0 forms one island. Any other 0 forms another island.<br />
Example, for the string: 1110110<br />
We have two islands, [1110] and [110]<br />
<br />
Similarly, for the string 0110010, we will get following islands [0], [110], [0], [10].</p>

<p>Now, any number in one&nbsp;island cannot jump to another island by any possible swapping. Any number in the island can move within the island by any possible swapping.&nbsp;So we just have&nbsp;to&nbsp;check that all numbers in an island are in the range of the island position.&nbsp;That is, if an island extends from 1st position to 4th position, all the elements in the orginal array in 1st to 4th position should be in the range [1,4]. Can&#39;t see use of DFS, nor sorting. Single traversal.</p>
,<p>It&#39;s true that can be many n-digit numbers possible for a particular LIS array.<br />
But we can print any one of them and that shall be accepted. For the ease of getting the logic, I would suggest you to think about how you can print the smallest number that is possible for the given LIS array.<br />
<br />
For every test case, try to print the smallest number that will satisfy the given LIS array. I hope you will get the logic now :)</p>
,<p>See the constraints, T is 10^5 and N is 10^8<br />
<br />
T*N is 10^13. Therefore, your solution will get TLE. Think of a logic where for each N, you get your answer in O(1). Then your answer will have time complexity of O(T) ~ 10^5 which will easily pass. May be you need some kind of pre-computation.</p>

<p>In this kind of questions, write some values of N and corresponding answers to it. May be you will observe a pattern or some formula or requirement of some pre-computation.</p>
,<p>Let me first help you with the data types. You need long long int to hold k. But you need only int to hold elements of a[k] as each of its elements will be 0 to 9 (remember it is given %10).</p>

<p>Coming to your logic, think if you really need to construct the array a[] in this problem. I don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>Next, you need to use modulo property (a+b)%M = (a%M + b%M)%M to solve this question. Since the time limit is 1 sec and value of k~= 10^12, you cannot use two nested loops. You need to use only one loop&nbsp;to calculate the rest of K-2 elements (which you MAY need not store in an array)&nbsp;from d0 and d1. Also figure out how you can apply this modulo property inside your loop.</p>

<p>Next, to calculate the sum of digits, you can add an extra line inside the first loop only. Think of a more optimized logic. Much hints given in this answer.</p>
,<p>Check your code for the following test case -</p>

<pre>
<code>1
1000</code></pre>

<p>Expected output is 1, but your solution gives 0.</p>
,<p>In your solution, you checking if all the elements of the array are divisible by the smallest array element or not. Your code will give correct output if GCD (greatest common divisor) of all the array elements is the smallest array itself&nbsp;or 1.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s check this test case where GCD is neither the smallest element in the array&nbsp;nor 1.</p>

<pre>
<code>N = 3
Array = {20, 50, 25}

Your output: 20 50 25
​​​​​​​Expected Output: 4 10 5</code></pre>

<p>Also, please print your answer as left alligned.<br />
You are using:</p>

<pre>
<code>printf("" %d"", arr[i]);</code></pre>

<p>Correct way to print the answer should be:</p>

<pre>
<code>printf(""%d "", arr[i]);</code></pre>

<p>Just go through this link&nbsp;https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/factorial-large-number/&nbsp; to understand how to deal very large numbers using array.</p>
,<p>See this link,&nbsp;<a href=""http://recursionnitd.in/askrec/questions/14"">http://recursionnitd.in/askrec/questions/14</a>, i have answered similar question,&nbsp; you might get some help there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>First thing you need to do is , instead of takind mod of final value of&nbsp; j , you need to mod of value of j each time it is calculated in your for loop.</p>

<pre>
<code>for(i=1;i&lt;=n;i++)
{
      s=i%x;
      j=(j*s)%x;
}</code></pre>

<p>Since max value of<strong> n </strong>can be 10^9, so to optimise your code ,you should come out of your<strong> for loop</strong> as soon as <strong>j = 0</strong> using break statement.</p>

<pre>
<code>for(i=1;i&lt;=n;i++)
{
            s=i%x;
            j=(j*s)%x;
            if(j==0)
              break;
 }</code></pre>

<p>In this question you need to calculate charity .</p>

<p>Charity is zero when<strong> j = 0</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp; when <strong>j != 0</strong> Charity is equal to<strong> x - j</strong> .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>If you find the factorial of number using first method , integer overflow may occur because in the first method we are first calculating factorial of number, that must be stored in int data type, as factorial of number can be very large so it&nbsp;is not possible to&nbsp; store it in any integer variable.</p>

<p>But in second method, we take mod after every iteration of for loop to avoid overflow.</p>

<pre>
<code>unsigned long long factorial(int n)
{
    const unsigned int M = 1000000007;
 
    unsigned long long f = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
        f = (f*i) % M;  
    return f;
}</code></pre>

<p>As the&nbsp; value of a%b is always less than b ,hence on taking mod after every multiplication ,value of<strong> f</strong> is always less than <strong>M</strong> hence there will never be problem of integer overflow.</p>

<p>This factorial function calculates value of <strong>(n! % M)</strong>&nbsp; i.e it calculates remainer when <strong>n! is divided by M.</strong></p>
,<p>if you want to use getline after using cin,&nbsp;add one line of code cin.ignore() after cin.</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<pre>
<code> cin &gt;&gt; T;
cin.ignore();
    for(i=0; i&lt;T; i++)
    {
        getline(cin, A);
        getline(cin, B);
        
        
    }</code></pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
,<p>Input given in this question are the numbers either 0 or 1 , but these numbers are separated by SPACE ,since you are taking input as character ,space will also be stored in your input array since space is also character. So you must always take input in integer array for SPACE seperated integer.</p>
,<p>In this question, for each query you have to find the greatest common divisor of array excluding the range [l, r].&nbsp; So you have to precompute prefix gcd array as well as suffix gcd array.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prefix[i]&nbsp; will store greatest common divisor&nbsp;of all&nbsp; elements in the range [0,i]&nbsp; i.e. Prefix[i] = gcd(Prefix[i-1],A[i]).</p>

<p>Similarly Suffix[i] will store greatest common divisor of all elements in the range [i, n-1].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suffix[i]&nbsp; = gcd(Suffix[i+1],A[i]).</p>

<p>Hence,&nbsp;if range given in the query is [l,r] then gcd of array excluding the range [l, r]&nbsp; will be equal to gcd(Prefix[l-1],Suffix[r+1]).</p>
,<pre>
<code>for(i=0;i&lt;q;i++)
		{	unsigned long long int p=1;
			for(j=count_a;j&lt;p&amp;&amp;b[i]&gt;=a[j];j++)
			{	sum_a=(sum_a+a[j])%m;
				count_a++;
				size_a++;
			}</code></pre>

<p>......</p>

<p>p is the size of the array A, but you are using local variable&nbsp;whose name is also p, in the above loop,since the priority is given to local variable,&nbsp;hence the value of p will become 1, thats why your loop for array A runs only once;</p>

<p>Second thing is that the approach you are using will get TLE, since p,q and r are order of 10^5, so your approach won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Hint : Use prefix sum and binary search to make your code optimised.</p>

,<p>The graph given is undirected. You considered it directed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Testcase in which your code fails:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>2 1</p>

<p>2 1</p>
,<p>It is actually skipping for string A, not B. This is because getline() takes input unless it encounters a newline character (&quot;\n&quot; or when we press enter). So when it completes scanning the value for T, it goes to the new line to scan the value of A, but on getting that new line the first getline gets skipped and the value of A gets assigned to B.</p>

<p>To make it work, just add a cin&gt;&gt;ch after cin&gt;&gt;T (outside loop) where ch is of type character. It accepts the newline character after T. Now, it works!</p>
,<p>Firstly, don&#39;t use string::find. You should try to match the pattern (r x c) with all the sub-grids of size (r x c) in the grid of size (R x C) manually character by character, break as soon as a character is a mismatch&nbsp;and start with another sub-grid. But the time complexity of that will be O((R-r)*(C-c)*(r*c)), the worst case is when r=R/2 and c=C/2. Though I think this should pass as tests may not be that strong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We can improve on this by maintaining a 2-D prefix sum of the grid and matching only those sub-grids whose sum matches with the sum of the pattern.&nbsp;</p>
,<p>This type of sub-sequence is called Bitonic Sub-sequence. Your task is to find the longest bitonic subsequence. It&#39;s a standard problem.</p>

<p>You may check these links:</p>

<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWHytKnOPaQ</p>

<p>http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-15-longest-bitonic-subsequence</p>
,<p>Your code fails in this testcase:</p>

<p>n = 3, q = 7</p>

<p>Array: 5 0 5</p>

<p>Your Output: 5 5 5</p>

<p>Expected Output: 5 7 5</p>
,<p>Another approach for the question Jadoo and numbers will be:</p>

<p>We can write n as a sum of n 1&#39;s. That is:</p>

<p>1 + 1 + 1 + .... (n times) = n</p>

<p>So, number of gaps where we can partition (every plus sign) is equal to exactly (n-1). For every gap, we have 2 choices, either we partition there or not. So, the final answer is 2*2*2*......(n-1) times = 2^(n-1). We can use modular exponentiation of simple loop to calculate this.</p>

<p>3 7</p>

<p>1&nbsp;</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>Correct Output : Yes</p>

<p>You are assuming that notes of value lower than the required value will always be included. But, this may not be the case as in the above test case we can make 7 without including 1 and 3.</p>

<p>The idea here is to generate all the possible combinations of notes and check whether there exists any such combination in which the sum of notes is equal to the sum required. In the above test case total combinations possible will be 2^3&nbsp;:</p>

<p>NIL</p>

<p>1</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>7</p>

<p>1 3</p>

<p>1 7</p>

<p>3 7</p>

<p>1 3 7</p>

<p>Out of which the correct answer is the 4th&nbsp;combination. So, try generating all subsets and find its&nbsp;sum. If any sum is equal to required sum then output will be yes else no.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while(scanf(&quot;%lld&quot;,&amp;n)!=EOF)</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<p>instead of taking any test case.</p>

<p>Hint : Use some data structure (say map) to store values instead of calculating again and again.</p>
,<p>Example: 1 6 3 4 2 5</p>

<p>You have that permutation of 6 numbers(from 1 to 6).</p>

<p>Now, for the inverse you start looking from 1 to 6 the numbers in the example, I mean:</p>

<p>The number 1 in wich position is located at 1 6 3 4 2 5? It is located first. So, the first number in the inverse is 1.</p>

<p>Inverse so far: 1XXXXX</p>

<p>The number 2 in wich position is located at 1 6 3 4 2 5? It is located 5th. So, the second number in the inverse is 5.</p>

<p>Inverse so far:15XXXX</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>The number 6 in wich position is located at 1 6 3 4 2 5? It is located 2nd. So, the 6th position in the inverse is 2.</p>

<p>Inverse so far:153462</p>

<p>This means this permutation is not ambiguous. Because 1 6 3 4 2 5 !=1 5 3 4 6 2.</p>

<p>Now, with 1 4 3 2(from 1 to 4)</p>

<p>In wich position is located 1 at 1 4 3 2. It&#39;s first, so the first number in the inverse is 1</p>

<p>In wich position is located 2 at 1 4 3 2. It&#39;s 4th, so the second number in inverse is 4</p>

<p>In wich position is located 3 at 1 4 3 2. It&#39;s 3rd, so the third numberse in the inverse is 3</p>

<p>In wich position is located 4 at 1 4 3 2. It&#39;s 2nd, so the fourth number in the inverse is 2</p>

<p>1 4 3 2 = 1 4 3 2, so this is an ambiguos permutation.</p>

<p>Notice that you need start looking from 1 until n.</p>

<p>// source :&nbsp;https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/15383/ambiguous-permutations-explain-the-statement</p>
,<p>It&#39;s pretty straightforward (simple dp approach).Make another 2D matrix and initialize its value as 0 then for every cell store the value as &quot;max of upper cell and upper left&nbsp;cell&nbsp; + current cell value&quot; and so on.<br />
For example:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original matrix :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New Matrix :</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 0 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 3 2</p>

<p>Also require help in the part of converting a huge decimal value to two integral integer values as numerator and denominator, since multiplying by a power of 10 doesn&#39;t give accurate results and might need multiplication with a prime number.</p>

,<p>I managed to find a recursive solution which gives tle for last test case of second subtask and first test case of last. This is because I couldn&#39;t find a way to cache the computed value so there was repitition of calculation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My process included finding all possible negatives in pairs and then taking triplets to find all cases that produce negative sum . I take the negatives only in a seperate array and all I now have to do is&nbsp; find all combinations in which no two negatives are adjacent .&nbsp;</p>

<code>#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;conio.h&gt;
int main()
{
	char p;
	int i,c=0;
	static int arr[10];
	do
	{	p=getche();    //using getche to take input that large no.
		if(p!='\n')
			arr[p]++;
	}
	while(p!='\r');    //out of the loop after i press enter
    if(arr[6]&gt;=1)
    {

,<p>Question link:&nbsp;https://www.codechef.com/COOK92B/problems/CO92MATR</p>

<p>The problem asked that, we have replace each -1 with +ve integers, such that all rows and columns are in non-decreasing order. So, i am taking a 2D array and taking the input. But, to go to each &#39;-1&#39; and comparing it with its neighbouring elements(which can be atmax 4), will require use of <u><strong>LOTS OF NESTED LOOPS</strong></u>. And adding to that we have to consider all the possible cases where -1 can be,like at the top or top-left or middle of the matrix.</p>

<p>Is there is any easier and compact approach to this problem ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>answer link:&nbsp;https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/17942109</p>

<p>I am pretty much sure, that my code is correct, still it is giving wrong answer.</p>

<p>The logic which i have used is, for a particular y, sum= (X(j) + Y) * (Z(k) +Y), where j or k can range between (0 and p) &amp; (0 and r) repectively. Then i have expanded the sum calculating X(j)*Z(k) , Y{ X(j) + Z(k) } , Y^2 separately. Still the code is not running :&#39;( :&#39;(&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank You</p>
,<p>Question link:&nbsp;https://www.codechef.com/COOK92B/problems/CO92SUBW</p>

<p>In this question what i did is, atfirst found out the expression of t(n)&nbsp;for the series: 1,3,6,10,15... it is coming: n(n+1)/2. Now equating it with x(input given), i get the n(maybe float/int). If&nbsp;n is float,after converting it into int, i am calculating n(n+1)/2 and (n+1)(n+2)/2, and x must lie between this 2 value. Now i will check which will take shorter time i.e going from&nbsp;n(n+1)/2 to x or going from&nbsp;(n+1)(n+2)/2 to x.</p>

<p>this code is giving correct output&nbsp;for the test cases, but showing wrong answer in codechef, can u please tell me where i am wrong..??</p>

,<p>The problem can be done using normal recursion only. :)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
,<p>There are only 2 cases when A wins:</p>

<p>1. When it has an element more than once and it is not present in B. U have taken care of this case.</p>

<p>2. When A has all the elements of B and it also has some elements of its own which are not present in B. (below code)</p>

<p>link :&nbsp; https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/19397819</p>
,<p>i didn&#39;t know it had an editorial... sorry my bad :(&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
,<p>I have done this problem by vector and set. If u want my code:&nbsp;https://codeforces.com/contest/1020/submission/41494518</p>

<p>But the easiest approach is by arrays.</p>
,<p>The only mistake is that, you are not reseting your &#39;ar&#39; array to {false} after each dfs traversal.</p>
,<p>As the subset sum can be greater than or equal to x, first we have to sort the array in decreasing order, then do a prefix sum in another array, say of name, ptr[].</p>

<p>Then store the elements of the ptr in the map(say of name, m), with the ptr elements as &#39;key&#39; and index (use 1 based indexing) of that element as &#39;value&#39;.</p>

<p>Then for each query do a lower bound search for x in the map, and print the &#39;value&#39; of the element which is found. If the search results in m.end(), then print(-1).</p>

<p>Btw, Lower Bound search means searching in the map, till an element greater than or equal to x is encountered.</p>

<p>Be careful, you don&#39;t have to print answer for each query, but for each test case as whole.</p>

<p>Saptarshi&#39;s Challenge Solution :&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
<code>The substring which occurs maximum number of times will be of length 1. Every character of a string is a palindromic substring. We are simply required to count the maximum number of times any character appeared in the string. This is because if there exits a palindromic substring 's' of length greater than 1 and occurs k number of times, then at least one of character of substring 's' will appear a minimum of 2*k times. Thus, there is a contradiction. For example, if we find a substring 'abcba' which occurs 5 times. We can always consider substring 'a' which will occur atleast 10 times and will be the required substring.</code></pre>

To find sum of integers in the range l to r, we will find sum of integers from 1 to l-1 using above formula and subtract it from sum of integers from 1 to r. This will give the required answer.

<code>By checking some trivial cases you can find that there is some pattern and for any number n, the number of ways is 2^(n-1). Now we are going to prove this by induction. We can make a general formula out of it. Let f(n) be the number of partitions of an integer n. 

f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 2

As n can be split in n, {1,n-1} and {n-1,1} and last two terms have one common solution {1,1,1...} so in mathematical form :)

f(n) = 1(without any spliting) + f(n-1) + f(n-1) - 1(for common solution)

f(n) = 2*f(n-1)

if we solve this recurrence relation then we get f(n) = 2^(n-1)</code></pre>

<code>Let s_1, s_2, ..., s_n be the prefixes of string S where |S| is equal to n and s_i represents prefix of length i. A function f(x) is defined as the count of string x as a substring in the string S. As every i_{th} prefix will be the prefix of j_{th} prefix where j &gt;= i. So, we can say that f(s_1) &gt;= f(s_2) ... f(s_n). Therefore the maximum time occurring nonempty prefix is the s_1 and answer to the problem is f(s_1).

<code>This problem is similar to the inversion count problem. Let assume in the given string S, the character at i_{th} index is c and the character at j_{th} index is p for i &lt; j, the pair (p,c) is called an inversion. In this problem, you have to minimize the number of (p,c) pair of inversions. If we swap the first occurrence of c and last occurrence of p then we decrease the maximum inversions as they are both the maximum contributors. 

However, there is a corner case. We don't need to swap if the last occurrence of p is before the first occurrence of c as this string initially has zero inversions which is minimum possible.

<code>This problem is based completely on observation and pigeon hall principal. First of all, there is always possible to find a non-empty subset in some range [l,r] for which some of its elements is divisible by (r-l+1) where l &lt;= r and not only subset even a subarray.

To prove this let consider an array A of integers of size n. If we can prove that there always exists a subarray for which some of its element is divisible by n irrespective of elements of the array then we can solve the original problem. Make a prefix sum array B of A. If we take the modulus of every prefix sum under n then there are two possibilities. 

First, we get all the remainder unique. There is n different possibilities from (0,1,2,...,n-1). As in this case, we should get a zero that means that the prefix sum is divisible by n. Hence, a subarray exist.

Second, we get at least one remainder that occurs more than once since our possible choices of the remainder are 1 to n-1 which should belong to n integers. Let x (x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; x &lt; n) be the remainder which occurs more than once at index i and j(i&lt;j). The sum of subarray a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ..., a_j under modulo n will be equal to b_j - b_i. Since b_i = b_j, the sum of the given subarray is 0 under modulo n and hence is divisible by n.

<code>The possible value of k is 1, 2, 4 or 8. Let's solve the problem for each of values independently.

for k = 1, the minimum number of deletion is zero as any number is divisible by 1.

for k = 2, the number is divisible by 2 if it's the last digit is divisible by 2. Since we need to minimize the number of deletions, we have to find from last the first digit which is divisible by 2. If it is found at index i we need to delete all digits with index &gt; i. This will be the minimum possible deletion

for k = 4, the number is divisible by 4 if it's last two digits is divisible by 4 i.e belongs to the set {00, 04, ..., 96}. For each element in the set, we need to find whether it is present in the number as a subsequence. If the two digits of the set are found at index i and j(i&lt;j), we should be deleting all the digits with an index between i and j and the index is greater than j. This way our resulting number will be divisible by 4. To minimize the number of deletions, we need to find our subsequence from last. It will take O(n) to check for each element in the set. Thus, total complexity will be O(n*(element in the set)). Besides, we need to handle cases when the number can be reduced to a single digit after deletions. For divisibility by 4, the number should be reduced in either of 0, 4, 8.   

for k = 8, we similarly need to check for the set {000, 008, 016, ..., 992}. Besides we also need to handle the cases when the number can be reduced to the length of either 2 or 1. For length 2, we need to find the subsequence of {00, 08, 16, ..., 96} and delete all the remaining digits. For length 1, we are required to find 0, 8 in the number and delete all remaining digits.

We can avoid these checking if we append 0 and 00 before the number for k equal to 4 and 8 respectively.

If it is impossible to make the number divisible by k in at most n-1 deletions then answer is -1.

Complexity - Overall complexity of the solution is O(n*m) where n is the length of string and m is ceil(1000/8).

<code>If we simply run a brute force then the solution takes O(n^2). The optimize solution uses the fast Fourier transformation. In the given problem, we are required to find all pairs of ones such that the distance between them is d and we have to perform this for every d from 0 to n-1. We have to represent our problem in some polynomial form. The distance between two ones is defined as abs(i-j) where i and j are the respective indices of the ones. We can represent this in polynomial form like - 

We define two polynomial:
A(x) = a_1x^1 + a_2x^2 + ... + a_nx^n, where a_i is 1 if ith position contains an apple and 0 if the box is empty.
B(x) = b_1x^-1 + b_2x^-2 + ... + b_nx^-n, where b_i is 1 if ith position contains an apple and 0 if the box is empty

If we multiply these two polynomials, the power of x represents the value of d and the respective coefficients represent the number of times the corresponding d occurs. This is because the product of a_ix^i and b_jx^-j accounts for the pair of ones at index i and j. So, after multiplication, we have to just find out the coefficients from 0 to n-1(which is the highest power of polynomial after multiplication). This polynomial multiplication can be achieved in O(nlgn) time by fft.

<code>Let start with some observation. you are given an array of positive integers. Let's define function f(i,j) as the gcd of all the numbers from range from i to j. As if some subarray has f(x,y) equal to 1 then all the subarray which completely contains this subarray also has f(x',y') is equal to 1. 

Let define another two terms left active point and right active point. For each index i of the array, its right active point j is the index of the last element of smallest subarray starting at i and having f(i, j) = 1. If there is no such subarray, right active point for i is n. Similarly, for each index i of the array, its left active point j is the first index of smallest subarray ending at i and having f(j, i) = 1. If no such subarray exists, the left active point for i is -1. We can precompute this information for every index by using a Segment tree or Fenwick tree.

For processing the query, as queries are offline(without updates), we can use standard Mo's algorithm. Let suppose, we know the answer to some range and we want to find out the answer for another range. To convert one range into some another range we require four types of operation.

Add to the range from left - if we add an element to the left in the range then there are two possibilities. First, the right active point of the subarray which starts from the point which we want to add into the range is greater than the right point of the range, the answer will be the same. In the second case if it lies within the range then answer will be incremented by (r-x+1) where r is the right end point of range and x is the position of the right active point and also r &gt;= x.

Remove to the range from left - if we remove the element to the left from the range then there are two possibilities. First, the right active point of the subarray which starts from the point which we want to remove from the range is greater than the right point of the range, the answer will be the same. In the second case if it lies within the range then answer will be decremented by (r-x+1) where r is the right end point of range and x is the position of the right active point and also r &gt;= x.

Add to the range from right - if we add an element to the right in the range then there are two possibilities. First, the left active point of the subarray which ends at the point which we want to add into the range is lesser than the left point of the range, the answer will be the same. In the second case if it lies within the range then answer will be incremented by (x-l+1) where l is left end point of range and x is the position of the left active point and also l &lt;= x.

Remove to the range from right - if we remove the element to the right from the range then there are two possibilities. First, the left active point of the subarray which ends at the point which we want to remove from the range is lesser than the left point of the range, the answer will be same. In the second case if it lies within the range then answer will be decremented by (x-l+1) where l is left end point of range and x is the position of the left active point and also l &lt;= x.

By using standard Mo's algorithm we can answer all queries in offline mode.

,<p>you have to use brute force approach and try all possibilities on first two elements and generate the rest&nbsp;<strong>AP</strong>&nbsp;for this two element. In&nbsp;last, choose the&nbsp;<strong>AP&nbsp;</strong>that have minimal changes. As you can make 9 such possibilities with first two elements so time complexity is O(n).</p>
,<p>hello, liman</p>

<p>first, the below test case give tle for your code.</p>

<pre>
<code>1

<p><strong>DP SOLUTION</strong> :)</p>

<p>I am going to explain&nbsp;you the top-down approach. we need two dp arrays like dp1 and dp2&nbsp;in which we can store the best answer for a prefix of an array. in dp1[i], we store the best result of prefix up to index i if the element at index i is going to be negative in answer and in dp2[i],&nbsp;we store the best result of prefix up to index i if the element at index i is going to be positive in answer.</p>

<p>first, you have to initialize both the dp array with INF and then define a base condition and then write the recurrence relation. you also&nbsp;need two cnt&nbsp;arrays to store the sign so you can backtrack your solution.</p>

<pre>
<code>base case:)

if(a[0] &gt;= a[1]) dp1[0] = -a[0];

dp2[0] = a[0];
</code></pre>

<pre>
<code>recurrence relation:)

dp2[i] = min(dp1[i-1],dp2[i-1])+a[i]

dp1[i] = min(dp1[i-2],dp2[i-2])+a[i-1]-a[i] // as two consecutive numbers are can't be negative.

for dp1 you have to check two coniditions:
1. a[i] is strictly smaller from both it's neighbours.
2. the consecutive sum of three elents should be positive.</code></pre>

<p>ok, that&#39;s all you need for implementation of this question. I hope you will understand.</p>
,<p><strong>NO</strong>.</p>

<p>there is no <strong>else</strong> statement in the code(link) but your code have.</p>
,<p>as from the question :)</p>

<p>P = 4(A + B + C)</p>

<p>S = 2(A*B + B*C + A*C)</p>

<p>where A, B, C are the sides of the box.</p>

<p>if V is the volume of the box than -:</p>

<p>V = A*B*C</p>

<p>try to express volume in one term of one side than differentiate it with respect to the side and you get the value of that side corresponding to both minima and maxima. take desire value and get the answer.</p>
,<p>in this code, your diagonal calculation is not correct. any diagonal have the minimum of nearest vertical space and&nbsp;nearest horizontal space.</p>

<p>like :)</p>

<pre>
<code>horizontal :-
    d1 = x-1;
    d2 = n-x;
vertical :-
    d3 = y-1;
    d4 = n-y;
diagonal :-
    d5 = min(x-1,y-1)
    d6 = min(x-1,n-y)
    d7 = min(n-x,y-1)
    d8 = min(n-x,n-y)
where x and y are cordinates of queen location in 1-based indexing.</code></pre>

,<p>You have a lots of mistakes in your code. Try to fix them.</p>

<p>note 1 : in has[n] = has[n/2] + has[n/3] + has[n/4] replace n with i.</p>

<p>note 2 : in return statement fun(n/3) appear two times.</p>
,<p>first, sort the array and try all possibilities such that u have the diameter up to d. This is a brute force as we have low constraints. If constraints are high then we have to use two pointer method.</p>
,<p>first, I suggest that you should run your&nbsp;program on the codeforces custom test and I don&#39;t understand&nbsp;why this algorithm is giving you right answer on code blocks.</p>
,<p>please don&#39;t post questions like that&nbsp;instead,&nbsp;you should explain&nbsp;your algorithm which you apply to solve the problem in your code then we might be able to help you.</p>
,<p>the intuition behind your code is not correct. so, try to fix it.</p>

<p>note1 :) you should improve your skills regarding how to write code.</p>

<p>note2 :) you should explain the working of your program or how you think to solve the problem instead of just posting the code.</p>

<p>note 3:) always try some random test cases and corner cases before submitting the solution and&nbsp;don&#39;t just stick with test cases.</p>
,<p>method 1 :)</p>

<p>to solve this problem you have to generate all the possible matrix of size 3x3 which is a possible answer to the question. from all the 3x3 matrix with the distinct element from the range [1:9] (which is 9!), only 8 is satisfied with our requirement. to generate these 8 matrices, we have to divide the portion of the matrix into three parts.</p>

<p>1.) center</p>

<p>2.) corners</p>

<p>3.) rest</p>

<p>as we know the element present in the center, have to participate in four sums(two diagonal + one horizontal + one vertical) and there is only one number which satisfies this condition and it is 5. so 5 has its fixed position.</p>

<p>if we consider corners then every corner participate in three sums(one diagonal + one horizontal + one vertical) and from the range [1:9] only even numbers are able to do that work.</p>

<p>all the positions filled by odd numbers(except 5) because they are only who can participate in two sums(one horizontal + one vertical).</p>

<p>for some more inspection, we know that 1 and 9, 3 and 7 are opposite to each other and from the same way 2 and 8&nbsp;and, 4 and 6 are opposite to each other.</p>

<p>by&nbsp;considering&nbsp;all these cases you can generate total 8 possible matrices.</p>

<p>transform the given matrix into any of them such that the cost is low.</p>

<p>method 2 :)</p>

<p>another way is that you can generate all matrixes and check if it is a magic square and how much cost you have to pay to reach up to this magic square from a given matrix. minimum from all the answers is your answer.</p>
,<p>use console input instead of getline.</p>

<p>LIKE :)&nbsp; &nbsp;cin &gt;&gt; A &gt;&gt; B;</p>

<p>we are using the fact that for any given &#39;D&#39;, we have a minimum value of divisor say <strong>x</strong> that will not give overflow and also all the values greater than this value not give overflow, and all the values less than this give overflow. So, we need to run a binary search over range 1...D and find the value of <strong>x</strong>&nbsp;and then answer is (n-x+1) except when the value of &#39;D&#39; is 1. the time complexity of the algorithm is O(log^2(n)) for each test case. we can also solve the problem in O(log(n)) time but this requires some generalization and bit manipulation.</p>
,<p>you are doing some precision error. try to fix that. for large output, your code has the precision error.</p>

<p>try test case:</p>

<p>1000 993</p>

<p>your answer is one less than the correct answer.&nbsp;</p>
,<p>you can solve the subproblem first. the subproblem is to find that a point lies inside a square or not. for that, you can use area comparison method.</p>

<p>now you have to generate the center of each square and run the above function for both the squares in which you pass all the five points (four corners and one center, one by one)&nbsp;with the other square and if it returns true that means the two squares&nbsp;intersect else we run the function with other points. there are total (5+5) function calls we have to perform. if any of them is true then answer is yes else no.</p>

<p>if you have difficulty to understand this approach then try to draw some diagrams that would help.</p>

<p>note :) you can also use another approach which uses some successive&nbsp;conditional checking but it&#39;s too complex and I don&#39;t think that implementing it in short contest is a good idea, but I give some idea about that.</p>

<p>condition 1:- check if x segment of both squares intersect or not. if no then answer is no else go next condition.</p>

<p>condition 1:- check if y segment of both squares intersect or not. if no then answer is no else go next condition.</p>

<p>and so on some more conditions...</p>
,<p>you have to precompute all the answers then answer for each query and for generating&nbsp;all divisors you don&#39;t need to iterate up to S/2, just go up to sqrt(n) and find all factors within this interval and generate the other factors using them... for more about it read this :)</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-divisors-natural-number-set-1/"">all divisors of a number</a></p>
,<p>try to run last two loops up to&nbsp;n-2 and to optimize your code,&nbsp;use some nlogn&nbsp;sorting algorithm such as merge sort, heap sort.</p>

<p>you can also use stl&nbsp;for sorting. please visit:&nbsp;https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-c-stl/</p>
,<p>first store information about trains in a 2d vector such that row&nbsp;index represent city from where the train start and column index represent the city where the train stop. then sort every vector row wise. Process all the the quries. As n is small, our brute force solution works fine. Our over all time complexity is O(n*q*log(m)).</p>
,<p>it should be helpful in your problem.</p>

,<p>I found it easy to implement segment trees using iteration instead of recursion and thats why i am trying to implement lazy propagation also using iteration.&nbsp; But i am not able to code the lazy-propagation&#39;s logic using iteration. Someone &nbsp;help me out and code it please .......</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When working with strings, why does it skip line for string B for the first repetition. For instance,</p>

<p><strong>Input</strong></p>

<p>3</p>

<p>apple</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>banana</p>

<p>orange</p>

<p>Jackfruit</p>

<p>Grapes</p>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<p>apple</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>banana</p>

<p>orange</p>

<p>Jackfruit</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even before I can type for the input of string B, it skips line and prints the output for string A. How can I prevent this?</p>
,<p>This is the problem I am trying to solve:</p>

<p>https://www.codechef.com/problems/ENTEXAM</p>

<p>This is my solution:</p>

<p>https://www.codechef.com/viewsolution/19393110</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I compile my solution, I am getting wrong answer. While trying to figure out why, I noticed that when I am sorting the total score in ascending order, it doesn&#39;t sort 0. Why is this the case?</p>

<p>Can&#39;t understand the question....</p>

<p>Please let me know what actually the question means</p>
,<p>Being a 1st year student i don&#39;t know all algorithms (such as :- DP,Graph) so when i practice questions in hackerearth or codeforces i get stuck as i can&#39;t implement my approach due to lack of algorithmic knowledge.</p>

<p>So, please let me know how to learn all those algo&#39;s&nbsp;&nbsp;as soon as possible to do well in competitions like SnackDown, etc . . . . . . . .&nbsp;</p>

<p>where, a can be any positive integer(non-zero)</p>

<p>and b varies from 1-700 inclusive.</p>

<p>we will exploit the fact here that b is bounded and can vary a for a given value of b.</p>

<p>So a^2&lt;=(y-b) or a&lt;=sqrt(y-b)</p>

<p>maximum value of a satisfying the above relation will be the floor value of sqrt(y-b)&nbsp;and&nbsp;</p>

<p>numbers 1,2,3,4------,floor_value(sqrt(y-b)) will satisfy the above relation for that value of b.</p>

<p>So we just add all values of floor_value(sqrt(y-b)) for each b from 1-700(inclusive).</p>
